Clojure is a LISP dialect of java. This is an effort to provide syntax support for clojure in gedit (http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/) , a popular text editor. 

GtkSourceView (http://projects.gnome.org/gtksourceview/) is the tool that helps us in this context.

##Usage 

Running the install.sh by the following commands will install the support for clojure in gedit.

$> sudo chmod +x install.sh

$> sudo ./install.sh
